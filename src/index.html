        <h1>Lead in Seattle Public Schools</h1>
        <p>Once every three years, Seattle Public Schools tests the water at each campus for levels of lead above 10 parts per billion. The test results show, as of early 2018, at least one water source failed that standard at 41 schools and Memorial Stadium. A solution that Chicago Public Schools is piloting could potentially lower the levels of detectable lead to less than 2 parts per billion. The map on the right shows how many Seattle Schools would have exceeded that Chicago threshold when they were last tested.</p>
